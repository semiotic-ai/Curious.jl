## TODO

 I generally recommend doing step 1 running this script, but it's not a big deal if you do it after.

1. Go to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) and activate this repo.
2. Once CI finishes running for the first time, go to Settings, Pages, and select the branch `gh-pages`
3. Once you've done these things, delete this TODO section and commit the change with the message `chore: finished repo setup`
